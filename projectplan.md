# Project Analysis Report

## Summary

Analysis of the SvelteKit project revealed several issues that need attention, ranging from formatting inconsistencies to TypeScript type errors. Most issues are minor and can be fixed quickly.

## Found Issues

### 1. Code Formatting Issues (Low Priority)

- **32 files** have formatting inconsistencies according to Prettier
- Quick fix: Run `pnpm run format` to auto-fix all formatting issues

### 2. TypeScript Errors (High Priority)

**44 errors found** in type checking. Main categories:

#### Missing Type Declarations:

- `lightgallery` plugin imports missing type declarations (action.lightbox.ts:2-3)
- Fix: Add type declarations for lightgallery plugins

#### Type Mismatches:

- `exif` property missing on Image type (getExifData.ts:7,10)
- `linkStyle` property missing on Hyper_DataFragment (Quote.svelte:46)
- `customTitle` property missing on various entry types (photos, work pages)
- Various prop type mismatches in components

#### Unknown CSS At-Rules:

- `@reference`, `@apply`, `@screen` directives in Svelte components
- These are Tailwind CSS directives that need proper configuration

### 3. Outdated Dependencies (Low Priority)

Minor version updates available:

- svelte: 5.32.1 → 5.34.7
- @sveltejs/kit: 2.21.4 → 2.21.5
- Various other minor updates

### 4. Configuration Issues

- Tailwind CSS 4.x configuration needs adjustment for proper at-rule support
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled but some code doesn't comply

## Improvement Suggestions

### Quick Fixes (< 30 minutes)

1. [ ] Run `pnpm run format` to fix all formatting issues
2. [ ] Update minor dependency versions: `pnpm update`
3. [ ] Add lightgallery type declarations file

### Medium Fixes (1-2 hours)

1. [ ] Fix TypeScript type errors:
   - Add missing properties to GraphQL types
   - Fix component prop type definitions
   - Update image type interfaces
2. [ ] Configure PostCSS/Tailwind properly for Svelte components

### Best Practice Improvements

1. [ ] Consider adding pre-commit hooks for formatting and linting
2. [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline for automated type checking
3. [ ] Document GraphQL schema updates process
4. [ ] Consider using `pnpm audit` for security checks

## Next Steps

1. Start with quick fixes (formatting and updates)
2. Address TypeScript errors systematically
3. Review and update GraphQL type generation
4. Improve developer experience with automation

## Notes

- Project uses Svelte 5 (latest major version)
- Uses pnpm as package manager
- Static site generation with adapter-static
- GraphQL integration with auto-generated types
- Tailwind CSS 4.x (alpha/beta version)
